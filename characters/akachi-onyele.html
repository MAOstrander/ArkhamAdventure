        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            For as long as Akachi can remember, she was trained to be the tribes' next 
            shaman. Studying at the feet of the old shaman, she learned how to speak to 
            the spirits, how to read the bones of the earth, and how to avoid the fell 
            creatures that dwelt in the dark places.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her education was supplemented by tutoring from an earnest young missionary. 
            Her mentor allowed the man to teach her as long as he taught her English and 
            other modern topics in addition to trying to convert her to Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for his religion, Akachi was uninterested, for she had already learned many 
            of the great secrets of lore, and felt the power of the old ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, her old mentor called her to his bedside. His face was pale and 
            gaunt. "Akachi, I have seen that a great trial is coming for you. You must go 
            to the United States, to a city called Arkham. There, you will have to face one 
            of the old creatures, using the things that I have taught you."
        </p>
        <p>
            Weeks later, as she opens the door to Ye Olde Magick Shoppe, Akachi hopes that 
            she can meet the challenge that lies ahead of her.
