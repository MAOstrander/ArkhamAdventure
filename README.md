Creating a site to enhance the ambiance of Arkham Horror

Planned Features (by Priority):
Setup (Before the game begins)
	1. Character profiles and stats
	2. Character randomized selector
	3. Ancient One randomized selector
	4. Game setup automater
	5. Ancient One profiles and stats
	6. Heralds
	7. Monster Gallery (Bestiary)
Ambiance (During the game)
	1. Slang of the era
	2. Music playlist to set the mood
	3. Soundboard of effects
	4. Randomized dice and widgets
	5. Monster limits and open gate limits based on number of players
	6. Game-state trackers
Victory (After the game)
	1. Score Tally
	2. Game stats gallery

These priorities also serve as the basic guideline for menu functionality. Upon completion of all this an API may be developed and implemented in order to include items, locations, mythos, and other game pieces.

The current site will be redesigned to be a mobile first site using Bootstrap to handle the spacing and menus.
