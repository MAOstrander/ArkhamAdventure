        <h3>The Story so Far:</h3>
        <p>Amanda has been a student at Miskatonic University for 2 years now. 
        On her way to talk to one of her professors last month, she saw a painting 
        in the hallway that captured her attention with its hazy depiction of some 
        horrible creature rising up out of the ocean. Ever since, Amanda has heard 
        strange whispers in a foreign language whenever her attention drifts. More 
        disturbingly, she has begun to dream of the vast green depths of the ocean 
        and terrible alien cities that lie in its darkest crevasses.</p>
        <p>This evening, as she finishes her shift as a bank teller at the First Bank 
        of Arkham, something out of the night calls to her-- something dark and sinister 
        that leaves the feel of sea foam in her mind and makes her gasp with the effort 
        of resisting it. Leaning against the brick wall of the bank, Amanda realizes that 
        she has to find out what's happening to her or she's going to fall prey to whatever 
        alien presence is invading her mind.</p>

        <h3>The Story so Far:</h3>
        <p>
            When you've lived on the streets as long as Pete has, you see things. 
            Things that would drive braver men screaming into the night. But you 
            also learn to be quiet, to stay hidden, and to play stupid if all else 
            fails. It also helps to have a good dog, like Duke, to scare away the meaner 
            elements of the street.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this time, Pete can't hide, and there's nothing Duke can do 
            to protect him. His nightmares have been growing steadily worse over the 
            last month, driving him all the way here... to Arkham. Even the whiskey 
            isn't helping much anymore. Soon, he won't be able to sleep at all. Still, 
            there are always opportunities for a man who knows how to stay quiet... 
            as long as he isn't too picky.
