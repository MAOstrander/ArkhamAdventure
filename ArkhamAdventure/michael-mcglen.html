        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            As a soldier in the O'Bannion gang, Michael didn't really believe in all 
            this voodoo mumbo jumbo around town. Or at least, he didn't until the night 
            of the Foreman job, when he saw Fast Louie Farrell pulled screaming into the 
            river by a scaly green creature. As they say, seeing is believing and Michael 
            is starting to believe.

            Now, he has gathered his belongings together in the room that he rents at 
            Ma's Boarding House. Louie was a friend of his, and he won't rest until he 
            finds out what's happening in this town and avenges his buddy ...
