        <h2>The Story So Far:</h2>
        <p>
            Monterey has been a globe-trotting treasure hunter and adventurer for many 
            years. Following in his father's footsteps, he's always tried to ensure that 
            the specific value of his finds is preserved. Recently, he followed a lead 
            on an odd prehistoric statue to Arkham. However, when he arrived, the man 
            he came to buy the statue from was locked up in the asylum. Monterey was 
            just about to give up and go home in disgust when a robed figure pushed 
            past him.
        </p>
        <p>
            For just an instant, there was a flash of a silver pendant with a symbol 
            on it Monterey would never forget. That symbol had been carved into his 
            murdered father's forehead, and had haunted his dreams for years.
            Chasing after the mysterious figure, he turned a corner only to discover 
            that he had lost his quarry.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Monterey knows that somewhere in Arkham may lie the answer to 
            the mystery of his father's murder, and he's not leaving until he finds it.
