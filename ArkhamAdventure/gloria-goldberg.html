        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            As a young girl, Gloria was haunted by terrible visions. After years 
            of visiting doctors and some therapy, she learned to control her visions 
            somewhat by writing stories. Her weird and disturbing fiction somehow 
            spoke to the public in these troubled times, and has made her a bestselling 
            writer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This evening, while leaving a book signing she's attending in Arkham, 
            she was knocked to the ground by the most powerful vision she's ever 
            experienced. Gloria saw the sky tear open, and a huge and montrous form 
            pour out of the very air itself, wreaking untold havoc and killing thousands. 
            As she sat on the ground with her arms wrapped around herself, Gloria knew, 
            somehow, that this vision was real, and that it would come to pass unless 
            she did something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, she finds herself in a run-down diner, sipping coffee and trying to 
            decide what to do.
