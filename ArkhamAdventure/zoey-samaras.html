        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Zoey knew that she was special. She'd known it ever since God had spoken to 
            her one night when she was six years old... the night that terrible fire took 
            away her parents. He told her that He had chosen her from among all the people 
            of the world to be His agent. She would protect the innocent and punish the 
            wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, He came to her in times of trouble, offering guidance and comfort. 
            He has also come to lead her to an evildoer on several occasions. In each 
            instance, with His aid, good triumphed. Then, one day, He spoke to her, telling 
            her to come to Arkham, where she would face her greatest challenge yet. He has 
            not spoken to her since.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, as Zoey steps off the train onto the platform, she fingers her cross, 
            feeling the wrongness of this place in her bones. Perhaps if she cleanses the 
            city of its taint, He will speak to her once again.
