        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            George Barnaby always had the need for control - control of his life and of 
            his surroundings. That's why, after spending a month in jail at the age of 19 
            for a crime he didn't commit, George became a lawyer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Possessing a keen mind and a charismatic personality, he found that he excelled 
            in his chosen field and soon rose to a position of power and wealth. George 
            enjoyed the challenge of practicing law, and the years rolled past in a pleasant 
            blur until he was ready to retire. He figured that he and his wife, Maria, would 
            buy a boat and sail around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was before the night when his home was invaded, his wife was murdered, and 
            his house was burned to the ground by two men wearing strange amulets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, he has tracked these men to the city of Arkham. They will pay for making 
            him feel helpless, and for taking away his dear, sweet Maria. after all, if 
            there's one thing lawyers are known for, it's collecting debts that are owed 
            to them.
