        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            As a traveling salesman, Bob is always on the go. But yesterday, 
            he saw something that made him decide to stay in Arkham and miss his 
            train. While he was in the General Store selling his wares, a robed man 
            came in and bought several items, paying with old gold coins. Astounded, 
            Bob turned to the shopkeeper for an explanation, but the man just ignored 
            his questions, simply saying, "That happens, sometimes."
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, Bob isn't leaving until he figues out where those gold coins came 
            from. If he plays his cards right, maybe this will be the big score. Maybe 
            he'll finally be able to retire and buy that boat he's had his eye on and 
            spend the rest of his days fishing in a tropical paradise. Then again, maybe 
            Bob will finally come to see that all that glitters is not gold.
