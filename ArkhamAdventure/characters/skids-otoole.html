        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Sure, Skids had knocked over a few banks before they caught him, but he'd 
            never killed anyone. Scared someone? Intimidated someone into handing over 
            his possessions? Yeah, ok, he'd done that, but he wasn't a bad person. He 
            was just desperate. When he told the cops that he'd needed the money for 
            an operation for his mother, they'd just laughed. Apparently they'd heard 
            that excuse once or twice before.
        </p>
        <p>
            His mother died of her illness during the second year of his sentence. 
            After that, no one came to visit him. He managed to cling to his sanity by 
            befriending his cellmate, a scrawny little guy named Brad Hollins. Brad was 
            a weird guy. He would rant and rave in a quiet voice every evening about the 
            "Old Ones" and tell Skids about bizarre adventures he'd had while dreaming. 
            Skids humored him until one night he'd woken up to hear Brad chanting 
            strange words, still asleep. Smelling smoke, Skids turned to look at his 
            cellmate just in time to see Brad scream and burst into flames. The screws 
            had tried to pin it on him, but really, there was no way they could get it 
            to stick.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, finally out on parole, Skids finds himself staying in a place that 
            Brad frequently mentioned in his ravings - the city of Arkham. Perhaps he 
            can find some answers to the questions raised by his friend's death.
