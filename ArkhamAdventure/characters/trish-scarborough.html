                <b>Abnormal Focus</b> <br />Upkeep: Trish does not spend focus to adjust 
                her sliders. Instead, at the start of each Upkeep Phase, move her sliders 
                all the way to the left. She may then shift her sliders to the right a 
                total of five shifts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Breaking the Limits</b> <br />Upkeep: Trish may spend 1 Sanity or 1 
                Stamina for one extra shift to the right when adjusting her skills. She 
                may do this up to three times per turn.

        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            It seemed so surreal when she was approached by a recruiter after one of her 
            gymnastic meets all those years ago. Somehow, she had come to the attention 
            of a nameless agency working for the government to protect the country. Never 
            one to turn down a new challenge, Trish had eagerly signed up.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the first things that they taught her is that there is strength in focus - 
            in joining the mind to the body to exceed the whole. With her agile body and 
            formidable mind, she was soon one of their best spies.
        </p>
        <p>
            But recently, Trish has begun to wonder at the motives of the organization she 
            works for. Are they really tied to the government, or is she working for some 
            sort of shadow society ruling the country from behind the scenes? Her quiet 
            inquiries eventually led her to the small city of Arkham, Massachusetts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Normally, newspaper buildings are something that Trish avoids like the plague 
            in her line of work. But standing in front of the Arkham Advertiser, she knows 
            that this is her last lead. If the information she needs is anywhere, it'll be 
            here.
