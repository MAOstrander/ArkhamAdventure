        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            As he was growing up on his parents' farm, it soon became obvious that Hank was 
            more of a doer than a thinker. He wasn't stupid, exactly, he just didn't spend a 
            lot of time thinking things through before he did them. A lot of the time, this 
            tended to get him in trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then again, sometimes it came in handy, like it had in the last month when he 
            heard the cows panicking. Picking up his shotgun, Hank rushed outside, only 
            to see some kind of giant buzzard thing attacking the cattle. Now, some might 
            have questioned their own sanity at the sight while others might have fainted 
            away in sheer horror. But Hank, he just took aim and blew the darn thing's 
            head off. It only occurred to him later to wonder just what it had been.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Pa saw the corpse, he told Hank that they were going to take it to a 
            Professor he knew at Miskatonic University. So, they crated it up, drove to 
            the nearest train station, and hopped a train to Arkham.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only, things haven't gone so well since then. First, the crate vanished off 
            the train, and then Pa went missing when he went to complain about the missing 
            crate.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Hank grows tired of waiting at the General Store where his Pa told him to 
            meet up if they got separated, he wonders if he might not have to start doing a 
            little thinking after all.
