        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Not so many people can say that they've climbed a mountain on every continent 
            that has one. Fewer still can say they've stolen a golden idol from a tribe of 
            cannibals. Among women in a male-dominated society, Ursula is probably unique in 
            being able to make these sorts of claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since she was a small girl, Ursula had broken the rules set down for her: 
            climbing trees, playing in the mud, exploring the woods, and plenty of other 
            things "that a proper young lady shouldn't have been doing."
        </p>
        <p>
            After all, she was as good as any man. When she was accepted to Boston 
            University, she set out to prove it, excelling and exceeding the other 
            students in Archaeology. She graduated top of her class and used her inheritance 
            to set herself up as an explorer, roaming all over the world and writing 
            articles for magazines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now her path has brought her here to Arkham, following a shipment of stolen 
            relics, a cult that seems to have members in very corner of the world, and a 
            trail of corpses. Smiling to herself, Ursula thinks, "Now THIS is an adventure."
