        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            All her life, Patrice has lived for music. The soaring sonatas, the graceful 
            arias, and the booming marches have always been her closest companions.
        </p>
        <p>
            But sometimes as she plays, she can sense something at the edge of her 
            awareness - something that watches her and waits, for what she doesn't know.
        </p>
        <p>
            The presence has been growing over the last month, and her increasing 
            nervousness is starting to spoil her ability to play the violin. That's not 
            something she can tolerate.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when an old gypsy she was swapping tunes with told her that she was 
            being watched by an evil spirit, Patrice listened with somewhat less 
            skepticism than she might have had even a month ago. The gypsy referred her 
            to a shop in Arkham that might have what she needs to get rid of the spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
            That explains why Patrice finds herself entering the Curiositie Shoppe 
            this evening, feeling a little silly and more than slightly nervous.
