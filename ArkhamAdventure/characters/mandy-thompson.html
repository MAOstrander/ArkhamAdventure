        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Mandy came to Arkham several years ago looking for work as a researcher 
            for Miskatonic University. Since then, she has worked with many of the 
            University professors, delving into esoteric tomes filled with scientific 
            information, historical reports, and sometimes even occult ramblings.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was while reading an old book of prophecies last week that she first 
            felt that she had stumbled onto something big. Mandy came to believe that 
            certain signs and portents described in the book were taking place in Arkham 
            right now-- omens that indicated the return of a terrible being reffered to 
            as an Ancient One, which would grind the cities of Man beneath its loathsome 
            tread.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonight, the full moon has turned blood red, which is the final omen of the 
            return of the Ancient One. Slipping into the night, and armed with her knowledge 
            of the prophecy, Mandy has decided to see if she can defy fate and stop these 
            events from taking place.
