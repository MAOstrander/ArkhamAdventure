                The gate is considered to have that dimensional symbol instead of its 
                normal dimensional symbol for purposes of removing monsters from the board.

        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            The stars hold secrets both great and terrible for those with courage - 
            or curiosity - enough to look. While Norman would never claim to be 
            especially courageous, he'd be the first to admit that he has an inability 
            to ignore a mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when six stars vanished from the section of sky he was studying, 
            he couldn't just let it go, not even when his colleagues told him that he 
            was just imagining things and sent him home to sleep it off.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took him years, not to mention the near death of his career, but he 
            eventually found his answers in a book that none of his colleagues would be 
            caught dead reading. An ancient tome, it described the stars and the sequence 
            in which they would vanish, even detailing the date when their disappearance 
            would take place. It was a sign, the book said, of the end of everything. It 
            was the harbinger of a great beast that would tear asunder all that man had 
            wrought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Norman isn't sure what he can do to stop the beast from destroying the world. 
            He knows that he isn't very strong, but if an answer can be found in the stars, 
            then he will stand in the path of destruction until his dying breath.
