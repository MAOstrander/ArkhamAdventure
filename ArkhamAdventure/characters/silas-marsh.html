        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Silas always felt the call of the ocean. Even as a little boy he loved to 
            play in the waves. There was just something soothing and otherworldly about 
            the sea that put him at ease in a way nothing else could.
        </p>
        <p>
            It came as no surprise to his family when Silas announced that he'd decided 
            to become a sailor and travel the world. They'd actually been waiting for him 
            to reach that conclusion for several years.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, he signed up with a merchant shipping company and spent the next few years 
            gallivanting from one port to the next and seeing all the sights he could take in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Periodically, he would dream. At these times, his sleep was haunted with 
            strange, ethereal visions of undersea vistas and bizarre creatures that 
            smiled toothily at him. Gradually, he came to feel that there was something 
            sinister about these dreams, and when he asked his family, they simply nodded 
            and said, "It's time for you to visit the main branch of the family up in 
            Innsmouth. They'll set you straight."
        </p>
        <p>
            Two days later, as he disembarks from a ship at the Arkham docks, Silas can't 
            help but find his family's remark just a little bit sinister.
