                <b>Slippery</b> <br />Mythos: When moon monsters move, Finn may choose 
                to move as a normal moon monster. He does not need to make any Evade 
                checks when doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Holdout</b> <br />Any Phase: Finn never has to discard items or 
                lose money, even when he is knocked unconscious or driven insane. He 
                must still pay costs as usual.

        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Prohibition was the best thing that ever happened to Finn Edwards. Until they 
            banned alcohol, he was just drifting through life, doing odd jobs here and 
            there. But afterwards, the demand for alcohol rose to such a fever pitch that 
            he was able to make a comfortable living evading the law and giving people 
            what they wanted. His new lifestyle particularly suited his personality, 
            providing him with a taste of danger, plenty of cash, and a great deal of 
            personal satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, those things are all well and good until you find yourself running 
            through the woods at night trying to lose a bunch of knife-wielding maniacs 
            who want to sacrifice you to their dark gods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Finn has never been a vengeful man, that incident left him rattled 
            in ways he hadn't been since getting beaten up on the playground years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stepping out of the bank with enough borrowed cash for guns and supplies, 
            Finn vows that those lunatics will regret the day they ever crossed him.
