        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Methodical. By the book. If you looked in the Federal Agent's handbook, 
            you'd find a picture of Roland Banks next to those sections. At least, if 
            it had any pictures, you would..
        </p>
        <p>
            Where other agents found the rules restricting and annoying, Roland took 
            comfort in procedure. It was a relief to have guidelines to follow in any 
            given situation. Well, at least until this latest case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try as he might, Roland could find no mention in the handbook of what to 
            do when confronted with strange creatures, gates through time and space, 
            or magic spells. This case was rapidly escalating into a fiasco, and if 
            he dropped the ball, losing his job was the least of his worries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sitting outside the Asylum after an interview with yet another demented 
            witness, Roland dropped his battered Agent's handbook back into his briefcase 
            and sighed. At least the agency was sending him some backup. Maybe they could 
            help him make some sense out of this mess.
