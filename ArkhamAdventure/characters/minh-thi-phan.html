        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Originally from Korea, Minh's family came to the United States to seek a 
            fresh start and escape Japanese persecution. They worked hard to get ahead, 
            and Minh was able to attend a small community college. Although she was often 
            teased or harrassed because of her heritage, Minh tried to focus on her 
            studies, reminding herself that her parents had faced much worse in Korea. 
            Eventually, she was able to finish her degree and landed a job at a small 
            office in Arkham.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially Minh was mostly worried that her employer might make improper 
            advances towards her, but Mr. Thomas seemed uninterested in her in that way, 
            so she relaxed and concentrated on her work. Then he loaned her the book. As 
            she started to read The King in Yellow, she found herself repulsed and horrified 
            by its contents. When she expressed these feelings to Mr. Thomas, he just 
            smiled oddly and told her, "Keep reading, it gets better towards the end." 
            Although fearful for her job, she returned the book to him, saying it just 
            wasn't her sort of thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day, she received a call from the hospital. Mr. Thompson was 
            dead - suicide - and for some reason she was listed as his emergency contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, Minh now finds herself standing outside St. Mary's Hospital with Mr. 
            Thompson's personal possessions, including that terrible book, wondering 
            what to do.
