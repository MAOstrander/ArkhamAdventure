        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Several months ago, Jenny was visiting Paris when she received a 
            letter from her sister, Isabelle. In it, Isabelle rambled incoherantly, 
            writing about men in dark cloaks following her wherever she went, and of 
            hoofprints in the woods, left by an enormous goat. The outside of the envelope 
            was partailly stained with blood, and it was mailed from Arkham. That was 
            the last letter from Isabelle she received.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jenny has since returned to the States, coming to Arkham to find her 
            missing sister. Stepping off the train from Boston into the dark autumn 
            night, she believes that her sister was abducted by a strange cult, and is 
            determined to find her and thwart the plans of those that took her... even 
            if she has to save all of Arkham in the process.
