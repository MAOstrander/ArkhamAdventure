        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Tommy Muldoon wasn't sure what was going on in this crazy city. He'd no 
            sooner graduated from the Police Academy in Boston than he'd been loaned 
            out to the Arkham Sheriff's department. That wouldn't have been so bad, 
            except that some of the stuff going on in Arkham was right out of a bad 
            horror novel. Weird creatures in the woods, people found turned inside out, 
            and worse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, Tommy had sworn to protect and serve, and he would do his best to 
            live up to those vows, no matter what. Besides, he had his trusty rifle, 
            Becky. what could go wrong?
        </p>
        <p>
            Standing in front of the Police Station, Tommy feels a shiver run down his 
            back at the thought. "Ok, Tommy," he mutters to himself, "Time to be a hero."
