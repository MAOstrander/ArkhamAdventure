        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            After returning from his stint in the army during WWI, Dexter 
            became a stage magician, and proved to be very successful at his 
            trade, but he always longed to find real magic. As they say, be careful 
            what you wish for. Years later, in a rundown store, Dexter came across 
            a burnt and torn fragment of the Necronomicon itself. Intrigued by this 
            ancient piece of occult knowledge, Dexter began to use his wealth in 
            search of the truth about the ancient lore, and what he found horrified him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, the more he learns, the less he wants to know, but his studies have 
            led him to believe that a great evil will soon arise in Arkham. He knows 
            that he may well be the only person with the ability to stop this evil 
            from swallowing the world, so he has come to that sleepy town to speak 
            with the proprietor of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe, one of the few magic shops 
            that contain true lore, and not merely the stage tricks he once studied.
