        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Even while growing up in Arkham, Darrell always knew that there 
            was something not quite right about the strange little town. After 
            graduating from high school, he went to work for the Arkham Advertiser 
            as a photographer, and in the years since, he's crawled over every 
            square inch of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last night, however, Darrell saw something horrible-- something that 
            has shaken his world to its core and torn away the safe illusions we 
            all foster to protect our minds and our souls. His editor says he was 
            just seeing things, but as he leaves the newspaper building, he knows 
            just what he saw and he intends to show the world! This time he'll be 
            more careful. This time he'll take pictures and prove that things are 
            not normal in Arkham.
