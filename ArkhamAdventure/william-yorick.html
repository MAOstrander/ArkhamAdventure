        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            If all the world truly was a stage, then William Yorick felt he had a bit part 
            at best. After studying for years to become a Shakespearean actor, he found that 
            dramatic monologues didn't put bread on the table. So, desperate for work, he 
            had accepted a job as a gravedigger.
        </p>
        <p>
            He figured that while gravedigging was an unusual job, there wasn't really 
            anything wrong with it. After all, one of Shakespeare's best scenes involved a 
            gravedigger. Sure, the work was hard and dirty, but William had never shied away 
            from honest labor before.
        </p>
        <p>
            That, of course, was before the weird corpses began turning up. Strange, inhuman 
            things, they caused William's flesh to crawl and his palms to sweat. He began 
            to see strangers watching him wherever he went, and he knew instinctively that 
            taking the corpses to the University would be the last mistake he ever made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which is why William find himself in the pews at South Church. While he has 
            never been a particularly religious man, he finds that Father Michael usually 
            has good advice. Today, William feels like that could make all the difference in 
            the world.
