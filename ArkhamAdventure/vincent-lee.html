        <h2>The Story So Far:</h2>
        <p>
            A Yale graduate of Medicine, Vincent has recently moved to Arkham from 
            Boston to practice at St. Mary's Hospital. Since his coming to Arkham, 
            he has seen far too many horrible and unexplained deaths - an elderly 
            victim torn apart by unknown wild animals, a healthy young man whose 
            heart exploded, and so many others. Their faces haunt his dreams, 
            especially the young man's terrified expression. After all this, small 
            wonder that Vincent has begun to wonder if there's something sinister 
            going on in this quiet Massachusetts town.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonight Dr. Lee made the decision to investigate the mysteries of Arkham 
            and stop the strange deaths. He is determined to see this through, even 
            if in so doing he becomes another puzzle for the next doctor who comes 
            to Arkham.
