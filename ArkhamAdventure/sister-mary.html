        <h2>The Story So Far:</h2>
        <p>
            Sister Mary has served the Church faithfully for many years, so when 
            she was sent to Arkham to work with Father Michael, a man whose writings 
            she had admired for many years, she felt that she was truly blessed. Now, 
            after witnessing Father Michael's strange mood swings and seeing some of 
            the bizarre practices that go on in this town, she's beginning to feel 
            that she may have been a bit too hasty ...
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, last night, there was a knock on the door of the church, 
            and when she answered it, there was nothing but a handwritten journal 
            laying on the steps outside. Reading it, she learned of strange cults 
            and terrible creatures that lurk in the darkness. Worse, when she 
            laughingly showed it to Father Michael, he turned pale and threw it 
            into the fire, yelling at her to forget what she'd seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, gathering her things and quietly leaving South Church, Sister Mary 
            has decided to investigate this town, and in so doing, reaffirm her faith.
