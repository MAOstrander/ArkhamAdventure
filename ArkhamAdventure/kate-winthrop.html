        <h2>The Story So Far:</h2>
        <p>
            A brilliant researcher, but a shy, lonely person, Kate Winthrop has been 
            working at the Miskatonic Science Labs for 4 years now and her supervisor 
            still doesn't know her name. That doesn't matter to her though, as she has 
            been working to complete a private quest for most of that time. Almost 3 
            years ago, she watched as a device malfunctioned, and Professor Young, her 
            long-time mentor and friend, was torn apart by an indistinct creature that 
            shrieked and gibbered before vanishing into the night. Since then, she has 
            delved into darker scientific studies, always hoping to find something that 
            would allow her to find and defeat that creature along with others of its kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonight, her research has finally paid off, allowing her to create a device 
            that can defeat the alien beings she has detected in Arkham!
