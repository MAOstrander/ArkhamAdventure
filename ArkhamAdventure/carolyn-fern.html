        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Carolyn is a first year resident at a sanitarium in Providence. 
            Over the past six months, she has been studying the dreams of her 
            patients using hypnosis. One patient in particular gave her vivid and 
            disturbing descriptions of his dreams, right up until he was murdered 
            with a strange knife that closely resembled something from one of his 
            nightmares.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disturbed and frightened by his murder, Carolyn dug back through 
            her notes, poring over them late into the night. Finally, she found 
            some subtle clues that led her here, to Arkham, where he was previously 
            an inmate in Arkham Asylum. Someone here has to know why a harmless man 
            was murdered for talking about his dreams to his psychologist.
