        <h2>The Story So Far:</h2>
        <p>
            The job sounded simple enough-- pick up a statue at the Providence Museum 
            and deliver it to a guy at the Silver Twilight Lodge. The money was good, 
            and the dame who gave him the job seemed sincere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadly, things never seem to work out that easily for Joe. Now the statue 
            is missing, two people are dead, strange cultists are on his tail, and all 
            clues lead to Arkham. Lady Luck can be funny that way.
        </p>
        <p>
            He's already tried talking to the Sheriff, but that flatfoot proved to be 
            worse than useless. Looks like it's once again going to be up to Joe Diamond 
            to solve the case.
